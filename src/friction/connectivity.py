"""Fix-site <-> test-target connectivity — the framing measurement, productised.

The original spec asked whether a change's fix sites reach the tests that guard
them: `sourceValues: $fixSiteIds -> targetValues: $testTargetIds`. Measured on
the 50 built instances, that direction is **backwards**. Code does not call its
tests; tests call code. So the directionally-honest question is *test -> fix*,
and the near-total coverage only appears once you drop direction entirely —
`relDirection: 'both'`, which silently means "shares a neighbourhood", not "the
test exercises this code".

This module measures all three, statically over each instance's `edges.ndjson`
(NOT the engine — this is a property of the built graph, computed with a bounded
BFS in networkx so the k bound is explicit and the result is reproducible
without a running node):

* **fix -> test** (directed): the original spec's direction. ~0%.
* **test -> fix** (directed): the natural direction. The clean directed signal.
* **undirected** at k=6 and k=10: the broad, weaker relation.

The gap between directed test->fix and undirected is the pytest fixture / setUp
/ parametrize / framework-dispatch closure that a static call graph never sees:
a test reaches the code it exercises through machinery no `CALLS` edge records.
