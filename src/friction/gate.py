"""The gate: is it safe to skip tests based on this code graph?

Every graph-based test selector answers "which tests does this change affect?"
by walking the call graph backwards from the changed symbol — tests call code,
so an affected test sits upstream. Whatever the walk does not reach gets skipped.

That is only safe if the graph's *recall* of the test -> code relation is known.
This module reproduces the selection (`select_tests`), measures its recall
against labelled ground truth (`audit_recall`), turns the measurement into a
decision (`gate`), and compares the two extraction arms on the same instances
(`compare_arms`).

The distinction the product rests on: a walk that exhausts its frontier is
**graph-complete** — complete with respect to the edges the graph contains. It
is not **program-complete**. An extractor cannot fail-closed on an edge it never
knew existed, so graph-completeness is silent about missing edges. Only a recall
measurement against labels can speak to those.

Prior art, deliberately not re-claimed: safe regression test selection is
Rothermel & Harrold (IEEE TSE 1998); static RTS unsafety is Legunsen et al.
(FSE 2016); reflection as its cause is Shi et al. (OOPSLA 2019). What is new
here is the domain (the graph class LLM coding agents build), the oracle
(SWE-bench FAIL_TO_PASS rather than a dynamic RTS tool), and the link to agent
abstention. See docs/related-work.md.
